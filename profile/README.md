- every Tuesday, we share tools; we find amazing. Some get to be published on [TK's global-toolkit](https://techkln.dev/global-toolkit). (PRs are welcome)

Making this community safe is our joint responsibility but the back rests on the admins ([Stan_MD](https://github.com/NdagiStanley) and [Susan](https://github.com/NdagiSusan)) therefore do DM them (on the [platforms](#platforms)) or the [TK socials](#socials) in case of an issue or concern.
